## Problem 5

**Expressions as Graphs.**

**(a)** Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of the standard arithmetical operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Give an $O(n)$ algorithm for evaluating such an expression, where there are $n$ nodes in the tree.

**(b)** Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a DAG with common subexpressions removed. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is
one of the standard arithmetical operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Give an $O(n+m)$ algorithm for evaluating such a DAG with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges.
