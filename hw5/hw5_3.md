## Problem 3

Given an $n \times m$ grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left $(1,1)$ to bottom right $(n,m)$ that minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. You can only move either down $(++i)$ or right $(++j)$ at any point in time. What is the running time of your algorithm?
