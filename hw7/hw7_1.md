## Problem 1

You are given a list $D[n]$ of $n$ words each of length $k$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$. The words are sorted in lexicographic order.

Describe an algorithm to efficiently identify the order of the symbols in $\Sigma$. Assume $D[n]$ always contains enough information to
completely determine the order of the symbols.
