## Problem 1

The traveling salesman problem can be defined in two ways:
-  The Traveling Salesman Problem
   -  **Input:** A weighted graph $G$
   -  **Output:** Which tour $(v_1, v_2, \ldots , v_n)$ minimizes $\Sigma_{i=1}^{nâˆ’1} \left(d[v_i, v_i+1]\right) + d[v_n, v_1]$
-  The Traveling Salesman *Decision* Problem
   -  **Input:** A weighted graph $G$ and an integer $k$
   -  **Output:** Does there exist an TSP tour with cost $\leq k$

***Suppose*** we are given an algorithm that can solve the traveling salesman decision problem in linear time. Give an efficient algorithm to find the actual TSP tour by making a polynomial number of calls to this subroutine.
