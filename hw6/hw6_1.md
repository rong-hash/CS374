## Problem 1

**Largest Square of $1$'s.** You are given a $n \times n$ bitonic array $A$ and the goal is to find the set of elements within that array that form a square filled with only $1$â€™s.

<br>

## Solution

*Memoization.* We define a function $LS(i, j), i, j \in [1, n+1]$. It records the size of the largest square of $1$'s that can be formed with the top-left corner at $(i, j)$. The matrix is filled from bottom-right to top-left.

*Recurrence function.* The function is intentionally defined to "overflow" at the bottom and right edges to simplify the recurrence.

$$ LS(i, j) =
\begin{cases}
	0 &
	\begin{aligned}
		& A(i, j) = 0 \\
		\text{ or } & i = n+1 \\
		\text{ or } & j = n+1 \\
	\end{aligned} \\
	1 + \min \left\{
	\begin{aligned}
		& LS(i+1, j) \\
		& LS(i, j+1) \\
		& LS(i+1, j+1) \\
	\end{aligned}
	\right\} & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases} $$

The intuition is that if the current cell is $1$, then it can "merge" the squares of its neighbors to form a larger square; otherwise, it acts as a "obstacle" and forcefully resets the counter.

*Time Complexity.* Since we are filling $O(n^2)$ cells and each cell takes $O(1)$ time to compute, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.
