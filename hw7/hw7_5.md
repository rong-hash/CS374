## Problem 5

You are given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ with possibly negative weighted edges.

**(a)** Suppose you know that the shortest path between any two vertices is guaranteed to have **at most** $k$ edges. Give an algorithm that finds the shortest path between two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $O(k(n + m))$ time.

**(b)** Suppose you know the shortest path from $u$ to v contains **exactly** $k$ edges. Give an algorithm that finds the shortest path between two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $O(k(n + m))$ time. Note that the path need not be simple.
