## Problem 5

A certain string processing language allows the programmer to break a string into two pieces. It costs $n$ units of time to break a string of $n$ characters into two pieces, since this involves copying the old string.

A programmer wants to break a string into many pieces, and the order in which the breaks are made can affect the total amount of time used. Give a dynamic programming algorithm that takes a list of character positions after
which to break and determines the cheapest break cost in $O(n^3)$ time.

## Solution

Given string s of length n, breaking points array B of length m, after breaking, the string is divided into s[0 : B[0]], s[B[0] + 1 : B[1]] ... s[B[m-1] + 1, n-1].

For the convenience of indexing, we add -1 to the front of breaking array, n-1 to the end of breaking array, B becomes [0, B[0], ... ,B[m - 1], n-1], so the subarray can be represented as s[B[i] + 1 : B[i + 1]] where i from 0 to m.

We use cost[i, j] to represent the breaking cost from breaking point i to breaking point j. Obviously cost[i, i+1] = 0 because the substring need not to be cut. For cost[i, j], it can be represented as 

$$ cost[i, j] = min_{i \lt k \lt j} (cost[i, k] + cost[k, j] + B[j] - B[i]) $$

which means, we simply iterate k between i and j, find the breaking point that can minimize the cost. And cost[0, m+1] is the final answer.

pseudocode:

```
function breakString(s, B):

    m = len(B)
    // make it 0 index
    B = x - 1 for x in B
    B = B.pushfront(-1)
    B = B.pushback(n-1)
    cost = [[-1, ..., -1], ... ,[-1, ..., -1]] with shape (m + 2, m + 2)
    // iterate from 0 to m
    for i in range(m+1):
        cost[i, i+1] = 0
    // iterate from 0 to m + 1
    for i in range(0, m)
        for j in range(i + 2, m + 2):
            min_cost = MAGIC_BIG_NUM
            for k in range(i+1, j):
                costnum = cost[i, k] + cost[k, j] + B[j] - B[i]
                if (costnum < min_cost):
                    min_cost = costnum
            cost[i, j] = min_cost
    return cost[0, m+1]
```
