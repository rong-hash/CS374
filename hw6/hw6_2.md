## Problem 2

Suppose you are given $n$ poker chips stacked in two stacks, where the edges of all chips can be seen. Each chip is one of three colors. A turn consists of choosing a color and removing all chips of that color from the tops of the stacks.

The goal is to minimize the number of turns until the chips are gone. Give an $O(n^2)$ dynamic programming algorithm to find the best strategy for a given pair of chip piles.
