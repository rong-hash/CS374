## Problem 1

Suppose we have a river and on either side are a number of cities numbered from $1$ to $n$ (North side: $N [1 \ldots n]$, South side: $S[1 \ldots n]$). The city planner wants to connect certain cities together using bridges and has a list of the desired crossings ($x$ is a $2 \times k$ array where
$k$ is the number of planned bridges).

Unfortunately, as we know, bridges cannot cross one another over water, so the city planner must focus on building the most bridges from his plan that do not intersect. Describe an algorithm that finds the maximum number of non-intersecting bridges.
