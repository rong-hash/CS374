## Problem 3

**The low-degree spanning tree problem.** Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, does $G$ contain a spanning tree such that all vertices in the tree have degree at most $k$?

**(a)** Prove that the low-degree spanning tree problem is NP-hard with a reduction from Hamiltonian path.

**(b)** Consider **the high-degree spanning tree problem.** Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, does $G$ contain a spanning tree whose highest degree vertex is *at least* $k$? Give an efficient algorithm to solve this problem and analyze its time complexity.
