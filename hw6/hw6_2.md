## Problem 2

Suppose you are given $n$ poker chips stacked in two stacks, where the edges of all chips can be seen. Each chip is one of three colors. A turn consists of choosing a color and removing all chips of that color from the tops of the stacks.

The goal is to minimize the number of turns until the chips are gone. Give an $O(n^2)$ dynamic programming algorithm to find the best strategy for a given pair of chip piles.

## Solution

It's a classical Backtracking Problem.

Algorithm

``` 
Find_Strategy(Stack1, Stack2):
    path = []
    optimize_path = []
    optimize_path_len = INF
    Backtrack(stack1, stack2, path)
    return optimize_path

Backtrack(stack1, stack2, path):
    if isempty(stack1) and isempty(stack2):
        if len(path) < optimize_path_len
            optimize_path = path
        return 
    for color in set(Color on the top of stack1, stack2)
        path.append(color)
        while !is_empty(stack1) and color == stack1[0]
            stack1 = stack1[1:]
        while !is_empty(stack2) and color == stack2[0]
            stack2 = stack2[1:]
        Backtrack(stack1, stack2, path)
        path.pop_back(color)
    return 
```

Basically backtracking algorithm is a kind of tree searching algorithm. The max depth of the tree is n and total node is (1 + 2 + ... + n), so the complexity is $O(n^2)$
