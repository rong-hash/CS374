## Problem 2

Consider a decision problem $X$ defined as follows:
- **Input:** A directed graph $G = (V, E)$ and a positive integer $k$
- **Output:** $\text{True}$ if there exists a subset $V' \subseteq V$ with $|V'| \le k$ such that deleting the vertices in $V'$ and their adjacent edges from $G$ leaves a DAG, $\text{False}$ otherwise.

Show that $X$ is NP-complete.

## Solution

For an arbitrary *undirected* graph $H$, we construct a directed graph $G$ by swapping every undirected edge $(u, v)$ with two directed edges $(u, v)$ and $(v, u)$.

We reduce the decision problem $X$ to the *vertex cover problem* and claim that $X(G, k) = \text{True}$ iff H has a vertex cover of size at most $k$.

---

*If.* Suppose $X(G, k) = \text{True}$,
- which means that we can delete at most $k$ vertices from $G$ to form a DAG.
- *Proof by contradiction.* Suppose these deleted vertices does not form a vertex cover of $H$. Then the edges left out in $H$ will "translate" into loops ($u \to v \to u$) in $G$, which is not a DAG.

Therefore, the deleted vertices of size at most $k$ form a vertex cover of $H$.

---

*Only if.* Suppose $H$ has a vertex cover $V'$ of size at most $k$.
- Then deleting $V'$ *and their adjacent edges* from $G$ leaves a number of isolated vertices, which collectively form a DAG.

Therefore, $X(G, k) = \text{True}$. $\ \blacksquare$
