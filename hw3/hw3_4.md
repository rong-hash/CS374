## Problem 4

An all-NFA $M$ is a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ that accepts $x \in \Sigma^*$ if **every** possible state that $M$ could be in after reading input $x$ is a state from $F$, in contrast to an ordinary NFA that accepts a string if **some** state among these possible states is an accept state.

Prove that all-NFAs recognize the class of regular languages.

## Solution

**Proof.**
