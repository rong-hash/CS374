## Problem 5

Are the following problems decidable or undecidable? If the language is decidable, explain why, and if it's not, prove it

**(a)** $T = \left\{ \langle M \rangle \mid \text{ M is a TM that accepts the string } 1011 \text{ in } |1011|^6 \text{ steps} \right\}$

**(b)** $T = \left\{ \langle M \rangle \mid \text{ M is a TM that does not accept any strings in } |w|^6 \text{ steps} \right\}$
