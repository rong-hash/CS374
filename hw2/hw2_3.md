## Problem 3

Let $B$ and $C$ be languages over $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$. Define:
$$ B \overset{0}{\rightarrow} C = \{w \in C \mid \exists x \in B, \#(0, w) = \#(0, x)\} $$
Show that the class of regular languages is closed under the $\overset{0}{\rightarrow}$ operation.

## Solution

**Proof.** We show that if $B$ and $C$ are regular, then $B \overset{0}{\rightarrow} C$ is regular. Suppose that $B$ and $C$ can be represented by two NFAs, namely $M_B = (Q_B, \Sigma, \delta_B, s_B, A_B)$ and $M_C = (Q_C, \Sigma, \delta_C, s_C, A_C)$.

We first construct a "swapped" NFA to our convenience:

$$ M_{BS} = (Q_B, \Sigma, \delta_{BS}, s_B, A_B) $$

, where $\forall q_B \in Q_B$,
- $\delta_{BS}(q_B, 0) = \{\delta_B(q_B, 0)\}$
- $\delta_{BS}(q_B, 1) = \{q_B\}$
- $\delta_{BS}(q_B, \varepsilon) = \{\delta_B(q_B, 1), \delta_B(q_B, \varepsilon)\}$

Since every state has an implicit $\varepsilon$-transition to itself, we are effectively changing the inputs of the self-loops to $1$. Correspondingly, all the arcs labelled $1$ are now labelled $\varepsilon$.

Such swapping turns $B$ into a purely "counting" machine, where it pauses when seeing a $1$ and uses the $\varepsilon$-transitions to "make up" for the moves. In this case, *any string $w \in \Sigma^*$ whose number of $0$'s equals to that of a string $x \in B$, even if $w$ is not accepted by $M_B$, will be accepted by $M_{BS}$*.

We then construct an NFA $M'$ that accepts $B \overset{0}{\rightarrow} C$:

$$ M' = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', s', A') $$

, where
- $Q' = Q_B \times Q_C$
- $\delta'((q_B, q_C), a) = \delta_{BS}(q_B, a) \times \delta_C(q_C, a), \forall q_B \in Q_B, q_C \in Q_C, a \in \Sigma$
- $s' = (s_B, s_C)$
- $A' = \{q_1 \times q_2 \mid q_1 \in A_B, q_2 \in A_C\}$

$M'$ is also known as the *cross-product machine* of $M_{BS}$ and $M_C$.

A string ending up in an accepting state $(q_1, q_2)$ has two implications: (1) $q_1 \in A_B$ so that the string has an acceptable number of $0$'s and (2) $q_2 \in A_C$ so that the string is in the language $C$. **Q.E.D.**
