## Problem 4

**(a)** Given an array $A$ of $n$ integers, find an efficient algorithm to compute the largest sum of a continuous run.

**(b)** Now assume that there are $n$ numbers (some possibly negative) on a circle, and we wish to find the maximum contiguous sum along an arc of the circle. Give an efficient algorithm for solving this problem.
