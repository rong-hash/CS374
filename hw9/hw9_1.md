## Problem 1

A *strongly independent set* is a subset of vertices $S$ in a graph $G$ such that for any two vertices in $S$, there is no path of length two in $G$. Prove that *Strongly Independent Set* is NP-hard.

## Solution

We reduce the *strongly independent set* problem to the *independent set* problem.

*Reduction.* For an arbitrary *undirected* graph $G = \left(V, E\right)$, we construct a new *undirected* graph $G'$ by
- adding a new vertex on every edge of $G$, and
- connecting two "edge" vertices if the edges share a common vertex.

Formally,

$$ \begin{aligned}
G' &= \left(V', E'\right) \text{, where} \\
V' &= V \cup \left\{v_{ij} \mid \left(i, j\right) \in E\right\} \\
E' &= \left\{
	\left(i, v_{ij}\right), \left(j, v_{ij}\right) \mid \left(i, j\right) \in E\right\} \cup
	\left\{\left(v_{ik}, v_{jk}\right) \mid \left(i, k\right), \left(j, k\right) \in E
\right\}
\end{aligned} $$

We claim that $G$ has an *independent set* if and only if $G'$ has a *strongly independent set*.

---

*If.* Suppose $G$ has an *independent set* $S$.
- Then the path any two vertices $i, j \in S$ has length at least 2 in $G$, say $i \to k \to j$.
- Therefore, the path between $i$ and $j$ in $G'$ has length at least 3 -- that is, $i \to v_{ik} \to v_{jk} \to j$.

This confirms that $G'$ has a *strongly independent set*.

---

*Only if.* Suppose $G'$ has a *strongly independent set* $S'$. We can swap every "edge" vertex in $S'$ with a "vertex" vertex such that $S'$ remains a *strongly independent set* in $G'$.
- Formally, if $v_{ij} \in S'$, then we delete $v_{ij}$ and add $i$ ***or*** $j$ to $S'$, say $i$.
- Suppose the minimum distance to $v_{ij}$ from $\forall u \in S' - v_{ij}$ is $d$.
- Every path from $u$ to $i$ must go through one of the "edge" vertices connected to $v_{ij}$, say $v_{ik}$.
	- If the path goes through $v_{ij}$, then the path length is at least $d + 1$ (append $v_{ij} \to i$)
	- If the path does not go through $v_{ij}$, then the path length is at least $d$ (change $v_{ik} \to v_{ij}$ to $v_{ik} \to i$)

In this way, $S'$ is still a *strongly independent set* in $G'$. Meanwhile, all the "vertex" vertices in $S'$ are now present in $S$! They constitute an *independent set* in $G$. $\ \blacksquare$
