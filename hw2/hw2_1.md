## Question 
This is a two part question. For the first part you’ll be asked to come up with several
(semi-)simple DFAs and for the next you’ll be asked to formally combine those DFAs into
one solution. Read the whole question before starting.

1. Describe the DFA that describes the following languages (Σ = {0,1}). Formally define
the DFAs and make sure their definitions are unique w.r.t. the other languages in 1.a
(will make sense when doing part b):
    1. L1
contains all strings where the substring 01 appears an odd number of times.
    2.  L2
contains all strings where #(1, w) is divisible by three.
    3. L3
contains all strings where the binary value of w is divisible by seven.

2. Let L denote the set of all strings w ∈ {0,1}
∗
that are in at most two of the languages
in part (a). Formally describe a DFA with input alphabet Σ = {0, 1}, that accepts the
language L, by explicitly describing the states Q, the start state s, the accepting states
A, and the transition function δ. Do not attempt to draw this DFA. At minimum, the
smallest DFA for this language has 84 states.

    Argue your machine is correct by concisely explaining explaining your DFA (it’s formal
definition).


## Answer 

1. Answer to 1.a, 1.b, 1.c

    1. Formal Definition:

        $$ M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma_1, \delta_1, s_1, A_1) $$

        where 

        $ Q_1 = \{q1, q2, q3, q4\} $

        $ \Sigma_1 = \{0, 1\} $

        $ \delta_1:  $
        |       |   0   |   1   |
        |---    |---    |---    |
        | q1    |  q1   | q2    |
        | q2    |  q3   | q2    |
        | q3    |  q3   | q4    |
        | q4    |  q1   | q4    |

        $ s_1 = q4 $

        $ A_1 = \{q2 \} $

    2. Formal Definition:

        $$ M = (Q_2, \Sigma_2, \delta_2, s_2, A_2) $$

        where 

        $ Q_2 = \{q0, q1, q2, q3\} $

        $ \Sigma_2 = \{0, 1\} $

        $ \delta_2:  $
        |       |   0   |   1   |
        |---    |---    |---    |
        | q0    |  q0   | q1    |
        | q1    |  q1   | q2    |
        | q2    |  q2   | q3    |
        | q3    |  q3   | q1    |

        $ s_2 = q0 $

        $ A_2 = \{q3 \} $

    3. Formal Definition:
        $$ M = (Q_3, \Sigma_3, \delta_3, s_3, A_3) $$

        where 

        $ Q_3 = \{q0, q1, q2, q3, q4\} $

        $ \Sigma_3 = \{0, 1\} $

        $ \delta_3:  $
        |       |   0   |   1   |
        |---    |---    |---    |
        | q0    |  q0   | q1    |
        | q1    |  q4   | q2    |
        | q2    |  q4   | q3    |
        | q3    |  q4   | q4    |
        | q4    |  q4   | q4    |

        $ s_3 = q0 $

        $ A_3 = \{q3 \} $

2.  The formal definition of DFA should be the product of above DFAs.

    Formal Definition:
    $$ M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, s, A) $$

    where 

    $ Q = \{q_{ijk}\} $ where $ i, j, k $ respectively belonging to the state number of $ Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 $

    $ \Sigma = \{0, 1\} $

    $ \delta:  $

    $ \delta(q_{ijk}, 0) =  q_{opq}$ where $ o, p, q $ is the next state number of $ i, j, k $ in $ Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 $ when the input is 0.

    $ \delta(q_{ijk}, 1) =  q_{rst}$ where $ r, s, t $ is the next state number of $ i, j, k $ in $ Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 $ when the input is 1.

    $ s = q_{400} $, because 4 is the starting state number of $ Q1 $, 0 is the starting state number of $ Q_2 $ and $ Q_3 $.

    $ A = \{q_{ijk} \} $ where at most 2 numbers among $ i, j, k $ satisfies the accepted state numbers of $ Q_1 $, $ Q_2 $ and $ Q_3 $.
