## Problem 3

The traditional world chess championship is a match of 24 games. The current champion retains the title in case the match is a tie. Each game ends in a win, loss, or draw (tie) where wins count as $1$, losses as $0$, and draws as $\frac{1}{2}$.

The players take turns playing white and black. White plays first and has an advantage. The champion plays white in the first game. The champ has probabilities $ww$, $wd$, and $wl$ of winning, drawing, and losing
playing white, and has probabilities $bw$, $bd$, and $bl$ of winning, drawing, and losing playing black.

**(a)** Write a recurrence for the probability that the champion retains the title. Assume that there are $g$ games left to play in the match and that the champion needs to get $i$ points (which may be a multiple of $\frac{1}{2}$).

**(b)** Based on your recurrence, give a dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the champion's probability of retaining the title.

**(c)** Analyze its running time for an $n$-game match.

## Solution

### **(a)** 
Just assume that champion take the while at first

``` C++
float possibility(int g, float i, float ww, float wd, float wl, float bw, float bd, float bl){
    if (g > 0){
        if (i > 0)
            return ww * possibility(g-1, i-1, ww, wd, wl, bw, bd, bl)
                 + wl * possibility(g-1, i, ww, wd, wl, bw, bd, bl)
                 + wl * possibility(g-1, i-0.5, ww, wd, wl, bw, bd, bl);
        else
            return 1;
    }
    else{
        if (i <= 0)
            return 1;
        else 
            return 0;
    }
}
```
### **(b)** 

To retain the champion, the champion need to take at least 12 points, so p = possibility(24, 12, ww, wd, wl, bw, bd, bl)

### **(c)** 

The complexity can be shown as a tree

```
            n
          / | \
       n-1 n-1 n-1
     / | \ /|\ / | \  
```

Each node take $O(1)$ computing, so total costs $1 + 3 + ...+ 3^n = O(3^n)$
