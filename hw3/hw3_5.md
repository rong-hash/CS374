## Problem 5

Prove this language is not regular by providing a fooling set. Be sure to prove that the fooling set is (1) valid and (2) infinite.

$$ L_{P5} = \{ w \mid |w| = \lceil k \sqrt{k} \rceil, k \in \mathbf{N} \} $$

**Hint.** $F = \{ 0^{m^6} \mid m \geq 1 \}$ is a fooling set that works. Also, the difference between consecutive strings in the language, $\lceil (k+1)^{1.5} \rceil - \lceil k^{1.5} \rceil$, is bounded above and below by

$$ 1.5 \sqrt{k} - 1 \leq \lceil (k+1)^{1.5} \rceil - \lceil k^{1.5} \rceil \leq 1.5 \sqrt{k} + 3 $$

All that's left is to prove that $F$ is a fooling set for $L_{P5}$.
