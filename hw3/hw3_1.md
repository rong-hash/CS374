## Problem 1

A *finite-state transducer* (FST) gives an output based on the transition instead of the current state. It is defined by a 5-tuple:

$$ (\Sigma, \Gamma, Q, \delta, s) $$

The output alphabet of a $FST_\textrm{AR}$ consists of two signals, namely accept and reject ($\Gamma = \{\textrm{A}, \textrm{R}\}$). We say that $L(FST_\textrm{AR})$ represents the language consisting of all strings that end with an accept ($\textrm{A}$) output signal.

Prove that $L(FST_\textrm{AR})$ represents the class of regular languages.

## Solution

**Proof.** We prove that a language is regular (i.e., can be represented by a DFA) *iff* it can be represented by a $FST_\textrm{AR}$.

---

*If.* For any given $FST_\textrm{AR}$

$$ M_{T1} = (\Sigma_1, \Gamma, Q_{T1}, \delta_{T1}, s_{T1}) $$

, we construct a DFA

$$ M_{D1} = (\Sigma_1, Q_{D1}, \delta_{D1}, s_{D1}, A_{D1}) $$

such that $L(M_{D1}) = L(M_{T1})$, where
- $Q_{D1} = Q_{T1} \times \Gamma$
- $\delta_{D1}((q, b), a) = \delta_{T1}(q, a), \quad \forall q \in Q_{T1}, a \in \Sigma_1, b \in \Gamma$
- $s_{D1} = (s_{T1}, \textrm{R})$
- $A_{D1} = \{ (q, \textrm{A}) \mid q \in Q_{T1} \}$

Here $\delta_{T1}: Q_{T1} \times \Sigma_1 \rightarrow Q_{T1} \times \Gamma$ and $\delta_{D1}: Q_{D1} \times \Sigma_1 \rightarrow Q_{D1}$.

The core idea is to explicitly encode the last output signal in the states. There is a clear boundary between the *next-state logic* and *output logic*; thus, the expression of $\delta_{D1}$ is unrelated to $b$.

We have proven that any language representable by a $FST_\textrm{AR}$ is regular.

*Only if.* For any given regular language $L$ represented by a DFA

$$ M_{D2} = (\Sigma_2, Q_2, \delta_{D2}, s_2, A_{D2}) $$

, we construct a $FST_\textrm{AR}$

$$ M_{T2} = (\Sigma_2, \Gamma, Q_2, \delta_{T2}, s_2) $$

such that $L(M_{T2}) = L(M_{D2})$, where
- $\delta_{T2}(q, a) = \begin{cases} (\delta_{D2}(q, a), \textrm{A}) & \textrm{if } \delta_{D2}(q, a) \in A_{D2}, \\ (\delta_{D2}(q, a), \textrm{R}) & \textrm{if } \delta_{D2}(q, a) \notin A_{D2}, \end{cases} \quad \forall q \in Q_2, a \in \Sigma_2$

The idea is to encode the status of the next state in the arcs pointing to it.

We have proven that any regular language can be represented by a $FST_\textrm{AR}$. **Q.E.D.**
