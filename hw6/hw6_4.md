## Problem 4

Plum blossom poles are a Kung Fu training technique, consisting of $n$ large posts partially sunk into the ground, with each pole $p_i$ at position $(x_i, y_i)$. Students practice martial arts techniques by stepping from the top of one pole to the top of another pole.

In order to keep balance, each step must be more than $d$ meters but less than $2d$ meters. Give an efficient algorithm to find a safe path from pole $p_s$ to $p_t$ if it exists.
