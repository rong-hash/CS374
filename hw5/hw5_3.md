## Problem 3

Given an $n \times m$ grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left $(1,1)$ to bottom right $(n,m)$ that minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. You can only move either down $(++i)$ or right $(++j)$ at any point in time. What is the running time of your algorithm?

## Solution

*Recurrence function.* We denote the grid as $G$ and the DP matrix as $M$. The DP recurrence is

$$ M(i, j) = \begin{cases}
G(i, j) & i = 1 \text{ and } j = 1 \quad \text{// upper-left corner} \\
M(i-1, j) + G(i, j) & i > 1 \text{ and } j = 1 \quad \text{// left edge} \\
M(i, j-1) + G(i, j) & i = 1 \text{ and } j > 1 \quad \text{// upper edge} \\
\min \left\{ \begin{aligned} & M(i-1, j) + G(i, j) \\ & M(i, j-1) + G(i, j) \end{aligned} \right\} & i > 1 \text{ and } j > 1 \quad \text{// interior} \\
\end{cases} $$

*Memoization.* $M(i, j)$ represents the minimum sum of all numbers along the optimal path from $(1, 1)$ to $(i, j)$. The matrix should be filled top-to-bottom, left-to-right. A grid can only be filled after its left and upper neighbors are filled.

The optimal path is obtained by backtracking from the bottom-right corner $(n, m)$ to the top-left corner $(1, 1)$, choosing the neighbor with the minimum sum at each step. Time complexity is $O(nm)$.
