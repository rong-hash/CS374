## Problem 1

A *finite-state transducer* (FST) gives an output based on the transition instead of the current state. It is defined by a 5-tuple:

$$ (\Sigma, \Gamma, Q, \delta, s) $$

The output alphabet of a $FST_{AR}$ consists of two signals, namely accept and reject ($\Gamma = \{\textrm{A}, \textrm{R}\}$). We say that $L(FST_{AR})$ represents the language consisting of all strings that end with an accept ($\textrm{A}$) output signal.

Prove that $L(FST_{AR})$ represents the class of regular languages.

## Solution

**Proof.** For the given FST, we construct a DFA $'M'$ such that $L(M') = L(FST_{AR})$:

$$ M' = (\Sigma, Q', \delta', s', A') $$

where
- $Q' = Q \times \Gamma$
- $\delta'((q, b), a) = \delta(q, a), \forall q \in Q, a \in \Sigma, b \in \Gamma$
- $s' = (s, \textrm{A})$
- $A' = \{ (q, \textrm{A}) \mid q \in Q \}$

The core idea is to explicitly encode the last output signal in the states. Note that there is a clear boundary between *next-state logic* and *output logic*, therefore the expression of $\delta'$ is unrelated to $b$.
