## Problem 5

You are given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ with possibly negative weighted edges.

**(a)** Suppose you know that the shortest path between any two vertices is guaranteed to have **at most** $k$ edges. Give an algorithm that finds the shortest path between two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $O(k(n + m))$ time.

**(b)** Suppose you know the shortest path from $u$ to $v$ contains **exactly** $k$ edges. Give an algorithm that finds the shortest path between two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $O(k(n + m))$ time. The path need not be simple.

## Solution

### **(a)**

*Intuition.* Assume the path runs from $u$ to $v$. We run the Bellman-Ford algorithm for $k$ rounds, and then backtrack to find the distance of $v$ from $u$.

To be more specific, we use a modified version of BFS to traverse all the nodes within $k$ steps from $u$.

---

*Pseudocode.*
- Create a BFS $\text{queue}$, a set $\text{visited}$, and a $\text{dist}$ array initialized with $\infty$ for all vertices except $u$
- Add $u$ to $\text{queue}$ and mark it as $\text{visited}$
- Initialize an iteration counter
- While $\text{queue}$ is not empty AND counter is less than $k$
  - Dequeue a vertex $w$ from $\text{queue}$
  - For each vertex $x$ ***adjacent to*** $w$ ***(Modification to B-F)***
    - $\text{dist}(x) = \min(\text{dist}(x), \text{dist}(w) + \text{weight}(w, x))$
    - If $\text{dist}(x)$ is updated, make $w$ the parent of $x$
      - If $x$ is not $\text{visited}$, mark $x$ as $\text{visited}$ and add $x$ to $\text{queue}$.
  - Increment the counter
- Among all $\text{visited}$ nodes, find the node $v$ and its *distance* from $u$.
- Starting at $v$, backtrack the parents until we reach $u$, adding nodes along the way to the *path* in reverse order.

---

Time complexity of this modified BFS algorithm is $O(k(n + m))$, as it iterates at most $k$ times, and each iteration processes all $n$ vertices and $m$ edges in the worst case.

### **(b)**

Same as part A. We find the distance and path of $u \to v$ after exactly $k$ rounds of Bellman-Ford.
