## Problem 3

The traditional world chess championship is a match of 24 games. The current champion retains the title in case the match is a tie. Each game ends in a win, loss, or draw (tie) where wins count as $1$, losses as $0$, and draws as $\frac{1}{2}$.

The players take turns playing white and black. White plays first and has an advantage. The champion plays white in the first game. The champ has probabilities $ww$, $wd$, and $wl$ of winning, drawing, and losing
playing white, and has probabilities $bw$, $bd$, and $bl$ of winning, drawing, and losing playing black.

**(a)** Write a recurrence for the probability that the champion retains the title. Assume that there are $g$ games left to play in the match and that the champion needs to get $i$ points (which may be a multiple of $\frac{1}{2}$).

**(b)** Based on your recurrence, give a dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the champion's probability of retaining the title.

**(c)** Analyze its running time for an $n$-game match.
