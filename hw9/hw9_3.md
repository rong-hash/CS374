## Problem 3

Are the following problems in P, NP, co-NP, NP-Hard, NP-complete? Either way, prove it.

**(a)** A $\text{kite}$ is a graph on an even number of vertices, say $2n$, in which $n$ of the vertices form a clique and the remaining $n$ vertices are connected in a tail that consists of a path joined to one of the vertices of the clique. Given a graph and a goal $g$, the *max kite problem* asks for a sub-graph that is a kite and contains $2g$ nodes. What complexity classes does $\text{kite}$ belong in?

**(b)** A $\text{4kite}$ is exactly the same problem, but this time $g = 4$. What complexity classes does $\text{4kite}$ belong in?
