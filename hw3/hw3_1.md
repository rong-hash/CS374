## Problem 1

A *finite-state transducer* (FST) gives an output based on the transition instead of the current state. It is defined by a 5-tuple:

$$ (\Sigma, \Gamma, Q, \delta, s) $$

The output alphabet of a $FST_{AR}$ consists of two signals, namely accept and reject ($\Gamma = \{A, R\}$). We say that $L(FST_{AR})$ represents the language consisting of all strings that end with an accept ($A$) output signal.

Prove that $L(FST_{AR})$ represents the class of regular languages.

## Solution

**Proof.**
