## Problem 5

Given an arbitrary regular language $L$ on some alphabet $\Sigma$, prove that it is closed under the following operation:
$$ \textrm{cycle}(L) := \{ xy \mid x, y \in \Sigma^*, yx \in L \} $$

<br>

## Solution

**Proof:** Suppose that $L$ can be represented by a **DFA** $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, s, A)$. We construct an **NFA** $M'$ that accepts $\textrm{cycle}(L)$ as follows:

$$ M' = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', s', A') $$

, where
- $Q' = Q \times Q \times \{ \textrm{pre}, \textrm{post} \} \cup \{ \textrm{start} \}$
- $s' = \textrm{start}$
- $A' = A \times A \times \{ \textrm{post} \}$
- $\delta'$ is defined as follows:
  - $\delta'(\textrm{start}, \epsilon) = \{ (q, q, \textrm{pre}) \mid q \in Q \}$
  - For all $q_i, q_j \in Q, a \in \Sigma$, $\delta'((q_i, q_j, \textrm{pre}), a) = \{ (q_i, \delta(q_j, a), \textrm{pre}), (q_i, s, \textrm{post}) \}$ 
  - For all $q_i, q_j \in Q, a \in \Sigma$, $\delta'((q_i, q_j, \textrm{post}), a) = \{ (q_i, \delta(q_j, a), \textrm{post}) \}$

Informally described, $M'$ has $|Q|$ "branches" that explore all possibilities of the cycled string's position compared to the original string by allowing the machine to start at *any* of the $|Q|$ states. Each branch has $|Q| \times 2$ states which use the $\{ \textrm{pre}, \textrm{post} \}$ flags to track whether the string has "cycled back."

Starting with a $\textrm{pre}$ flag, each transition can either **(1)** simply move to the DFA's next state as if performing a typical pattern match or **(2)** cycle back and "restart" the branch by setting the flag to $\textrm{post}$. With the presence of the flags, we can ensure that the string is cycled back *exactly once*. Finally, note that each branch has a different accept state corresponding to the branch-specific starting state.
