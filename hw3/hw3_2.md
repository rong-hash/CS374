## Problem 2

For each of the following languages over the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$, either prove that the language is regular (by constructing a DFA or regular expression) or prove that the language is not regular (using fooling sets). Recall that $\Sigma^+$ denotes the set of all nonempty strings over $\Sigma$.

**(a)** $L_{2a} = \{ 0^n 1^n w \mid w \in \Sigma^* \textrm{ and } n \geq 0 \}$

**(b)** $L_{2b} = \{ w 0^n w \mid w \in \Sigma^* \textrm{ and } n > 0 \}$

**(c)** $L_{2c} = \{ xwwy \mid w, x, y \in \Sigma^+ \}$

**(d)** $L_{2d} = \{ xwwx \mid w, x \in \Sigma^+ \}$

## Solution

**(a)**

Not regular. 

**Proof**:
Fooling set can be 

$$ F = \{0^n | n \ge 0\} $$

For any 2 elements in $ F $, without losing generality, denote them as $ a = 0^i, b =  0^j $, where $ i \neq j $, given $ c = 1^i $, we can get $ ac \in A, bc \notin A $. $ F $ is an infinit set and each of the elements belongs to different states, so $ L_{2a} $ is a non regular language.

**(b)**

Not regular. 

**Proof**:
Fooling set can be 

$$ F = \{0^n1^n | n \ge 0\} $$

For any 2 elements in $ F $, without losing generality, denote them as $ a = 0^i1^i, b =  0^j1^j $, where $ i \neq j $, given $ c = 01^i0^i $, we can get $ ac \in A, bc \notin A $. $ F $ is an infinit set and each of the elements belongs to different states, so $ L_{2b} $ is a non regular language.


**(c)**

Not regular. 

**Proof**:
Fooling set can be 

$$ F = \{0^{n+1}1^n | n \gt 0\} $$

For any 2 elements in $ F $, without losing generality, denote them as $ a = 0^{i+1}1^i, b =  0^{j+1}1^j $, where $ i \neq j $, given $ c = 1^i0^{i+1} $, we can get $ ac \in A, bc \notin A $. $ F $ is an infinit set and each of the elements belongs to different states, so $ L_{2c} $ is a non regular language.


**(d)**

Not regular. 

**Proof**:
Fooling set can be 

$$ F = \{0^n1^n | n \gt 0\} $$

For any 2 elements in $ F $, without losing generality, denote them as $ a = 0^i1^i, b =  0^j1^j $, where $ i \neq j $, given $ c = 1^i0^i $, we can get $ ac \in A, bc \notin A $. $ F $ is an infinit set and each of the elements belongs to different states, so $ L_{2b} $ is a non regular language.
