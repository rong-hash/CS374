## Problem 4

SAT reductions.

**(a)** **Stingy SAT.** Given a set of clauses (each a disjunction of
literals) and an integer $k$, find a satisfying assignment in which *at most* $k$ variables are true, if such an assignment exists. Prove that Stingy SAT is NP-hard.

**(b)** The **Double SAT** problem asks whether a given satisfiability problem has *at least* two different satisfying assignments. Prove that Double SAT is NP-hard.

## Solution

### **(a)**

Basic Steps
To prove that stingy SAT is NP-hard, we need to follow these steps:

Firstly, prove that stingy SAT is an NP problem

Then, reduce the SAT problem to a stingy SAT problem

Certification Process

(1) Pre-condition

Let (F,K) be an instance of stingy SAT, where F is an instance of SAT with K variables. We need to show that a set of assignments X can make (F,K) a true solution in polynomial time, which proves that stingy SAT is an NP problem.

(2) Target

We need to create a certificate that converts SAT to stingy SAT, i.e., X is the solution of F if and only if X is the solution of (F,K).
(SAT) <----> (Stingy SAT)

(3) Proof of adequacy

If X is the solution of F, then at most K variables are true in X. Therefore, X satisfies (F,K), which means X is the solution of (F,K).

(4) Proof of necessity

Assuming X is the solution of (F,K), it implies that X assigns at most K variables to true, and also satisfies F. Hence, X is the solution of F.

### **(b)**

DOUBLE-SAT is NP-hard. We can demonstrate this by providing a reduction from SAT. Given an instance φ of SAT, which is a CNF formula containing n variables x1, x2, ... xn, we construct a new variable xn+1. We then define ψ = φ ∧ (xn+1 ∨ ¬xn+1) as the corresponding instance of DOUBLE-SAT.

We claim that φ has a satisfying assignment if and only if ψ has at least two satisfying assignments.

On one hand, if φ has a satisfying assignment f, we can obtain two distinct satisfying assignments for ψ by extending f with xn+1 = T and xn+1 = F, respectively.

On the other hand, if ψ has at least two satisfying assignments, then the restriction of any of them to the set {x1, x2, ... xn} is a satisfying assignment for φ.

Therefore, DOUBLE-SAT is NP hard.
