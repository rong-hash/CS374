## Problem 5

Prove this language is not regular by providing a fooling set. Be sure to prove that the fooling set is (1) valid and (2) infinite.

$$ L_{P5} = \{ w \mid |w| = \lceil k \sqrt{k} \rceil, k \in \mathbf{N} \} $$

**Hint.** $F = \{ 0^{m^6} \mid m \geq 1 \}$ is a fooling set that works. Also, the difference between consecutive strings in the language, $\lceil (k+1)^{1.5} \rceil - \lceil k^{1.5} \rceil$, is bounded above and below by

$$ 1.5 \sqrt{k} - 1 \leq \lceil (k+1)^{1.5} \rceil - \lceil k^{1.5} \rceil \leq 1.5 \sqrt{k} + 3 $$

All that's left is to prove that $F$ is a fooling set for $L_{P5}$.

## Solution

**Proof.** Picking values $k$ that satisfy $k = m^4$ for some integer $m$ constructs a set

$$ F = \{ 0^{k\sqrt{k}} \mid k = m^4, m \in \mathbf{N}^+ \} = \{ 0^{m^6} \mid m \in \mathbf{N}^+ \} $$

that contains all-$0$ strings of length $m^6$. We now prove that $F$ is a fooling set for $L_{P5}$.

We pick two elements $x = 0^{m^6}$ and $y = 0^{n^6} (m < n)$ from $F$. Let $z$ be the ***smallest*** suffix to append to $x$ and $y$ such that $xz \in L_{P5}$ and $yz \notin L_{P5}$. Then $|xz| = (m+1)^6$ and

$$ |xz| - |x| = |z| = \lceil (m^4+1)^{1.5} \rceil - \lceil m^6 \rceil \leq 1.5 m^2 + 3 \tag{1} $$

We proof by contradiction. ***Assume*** that $yz \in L_{P5}$. Then $|yz| \geq \lceil (n+1)^6 \rceil$ and

$$ |yz| - |y| = |z| = \lceil (n^4+1)^{1.5} \rceil - \lceil n^6 \rceil \geq 1.5 n^2 - 1 \tag{2}$$

Taking $(1)$ and $(2)$ together, we have

$$ \begin{gather} 1.5 n^2 - 1 \leq |z| \leq 1.5 m^2 + 3 \\ n^2 - m^2 \leq \frac{8}{3} \end{gather} \tag{3} $$

However, since $1 < m < n$, we have $n \geq m+1$, and

$$ \begin{aligned}
n^2 - m^2 &\geq (m+1)^2 - m^2 \\
&= 2m + 1 \\
&\geq 3 > \frac{8}{3} \\
\end{aligned} \tag{4} $$

$(3)$ and $(4)$ contradict each other! Thus, our assumption is false, $yz \notin L_{P5}$, $z$ can distinguish $x$ and $y$, and $F$ is a fooling set for $L_{P5}$. Moreover, since there are infinitely many natural numbers, $F$ is an infinite set, and therefore $L_{P5}$ is not regular. **Q.E.D.**
