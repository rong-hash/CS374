## Problem 3

Your job is to arrange $n$ schildren in a straight line, facing front. You are given a list of $m$ statements of the form "$i$ hates $j$," which indicates that $i$ cannot be put somewhere behind $j$.

**(a)** Give an algorithm that orders the line (or says that it is not possible) in $O(m + n)$ time.

**(b)** Suppose instead you want to arrange the children in rows such that if $i$ hates $j$, then $i$ must be in a lower numbered row than $j$. Give an efficient algorithm to find the minimum number of rows needed, if possible.
