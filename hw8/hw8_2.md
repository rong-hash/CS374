## Problem 2

Until 2002, it was an open question whether the decision problem "Is integer $n$ a composite number, in other words, not prime?" could be computed in time polynomial in the size of its input. Why doesnâ€™t the following algorithm suffice to prove it is in P, since it runs in $O(n)$ time?

$\text{PrimalityTesting}(n) \\
\qquad \text{composite} \gets \textbf{false} \\
\qquad \textbf{for} \ i \gets 2 \ \text{to} \ n-1 \\
\qquad \qquad \textbf{if } \ n \text{ mod } i = 0 \\
\qquad \qquad \qquad \text{composite} \gets \textbf{true} \\
\qquad \textbf{return} \ \text{composite}
$

## Solution

*The [AKS Primality Test](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/algebra/primality_v6.pdf) (Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena, 2004)*

Because the input size is actually the digits number of n (in any base), but not n it self. Therefore, for number n, the input size is log(n). So for a log(n) size input the algorithm have to run O(n) time, which means that the algorithm is actually $O(a^n)$ complexity, where a is the base.
