## Problem 2

In lecture, we defined the recurrence of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem as

$$ LIS_{LEC}(i, j) = \begin{cases} 0 & i = 0 \\ LIS_{LEC}(i-1, j) & A[i] \ge A[j] \\ \max \left\{ \begin{aligned} & LIS_{LEC}(i-1, j) \\ & 1 + LIS_{LEC}(i-1, i) \end{aligned} \right\} & A[i] < A[j] \end{cases} $$

But when we worked out the problem in lab, it looks like

$$ LIS_{LAB}(i, j) = \begin{cases} 0 & i > n \\ LIS_{LAB}(i+1, j) & i \le n \text{ and } A[j] \ge A[i] \\ \max \left\{ \begin{aligned} & LIS_{LAB}(i+1, j) \\ & 1 + LIS_{LAB}(i+1, i) \end{aligned} \right\} & i \le n \text{ and } A[j] < A[i] \end{cases} $$

Is one of them wrong? If not, whatâ€™s the difference? Give a simple, short, English description of each recurrence. No long proofs for correctness are necessary.

## Solution

Both LIS recurrences are correct and yield identical results.

The first recurrence starts the candidate LIS $A[1 \ldots i]$ from the **beginning** of the array and scans forward, selectively including numbers less than $A[j]$. $LIS(i, j)$ represents the length of LIS in $A[1 \ldots i]$ among numbers **less** than $A[j]$.

On the contrary, the second recurrence starts from the end of the array and scans backward. $LIS(i, j)$ represents the length of LIS in $A[i \ldots n]$ among numbers **greater** than $A[j]$.
