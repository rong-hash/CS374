## Problem 5

A certain string processing language allows the programmer to break a string into two pieces. It costs $n$ units of time to break a string of $n$ characters into two pieces, since this involves copying the old string.

A programmer wants to break a string into many pieces, and the order in which the breaks are made can affect the total amount of time used. Give a dynamic programming algorithm that takes a list of character positions after
which to break and determines the cheapest break cost in $O(n^3)$ time.
