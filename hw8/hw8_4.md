## Problem 4

SAT reductions.

**(a)** **Stingy SAT.** Given a set of clauses (each a disjunction of
literals) and an integer $k$, find a satisfying assignment in which *at most* $k$ variables are true, if such an assignment exists. Prove that Stingy SAT is NP-hard.

**(b)** The **Double SAT** problem asks whether a given satisfiability problem has *at least* two different satisfying assignments. Prove that Double SAT is NP-hard.
