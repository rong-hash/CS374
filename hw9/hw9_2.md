## Problem 2

Consider a decision problem $X$ defined as follows:
- **Input:** A directed graph $G = (V, E)$ and a positive integer $k$
- **Output:** $\text{True}$ if there exists a subset $V' \subseteq V$ with $|V'| \le k$ such that deleting the vertices in $V'$ and their adjacent edges from $G$ leaves a DAG, $\text{False}$ otherwise.

Show that $X$ is NP-complete.

## Solution

X(G, k) is true iff G has a vertex cover <= k

If there is a vertex cover V' <= k, then after deleting V', rest of the graph can become a vertex set without any edge, thus is a DAG.


If there is a vertex set V' <= k, then after deleting V', rest of the graph forms a DAG, it means there is a vertex cover <= k.
